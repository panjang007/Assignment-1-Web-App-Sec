This website contains three main parts which are index.html, style.css and script.js. 
There are two types of validation in this form, the first one being validate early and the second is validate late. Both are based on the concept of Whitelisting.
The client-side validation is done inside the script.js folder while the server-side validation side is done inside the submit.php, accessed by the form tag in the index.html.
